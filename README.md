# mazeGenerator
maze generator using recursive backtracking and a population of agents to explore the tile set

The program is divided in the following sequential steps:
1. maze generation using backtracking
2. extrapolation of the resulting matrix into a 2D array of ASCII characters by expanding the walls from lines to tiles
3. use of the 2D array of ASCII characters to produce a tileset
4. use of the tileset by a set of agents that navigate the space using backtracking
